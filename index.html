        <h3> Project Description </h3>
        <p> My project that I have done is for Calculator. You press the numbers that you want to use and add a operator in and and answer will appear in the middle.
           This calculator has the normal function of + - * =, and the number 0-9.
           It also has addition functions of % ^ > < and also History.
           </p>

        <h4> Project Process </h4>
        <p> the process of this project was based around looking at information that I already have and  Resarching information to advance a Process / function.
            Since most of this Upgrade is adding on more ways to solve equations on the Calculator it made it easier to where some of the previous functions can be applied to another.
            also knowing some math function from school , made it fun to try and input onto the website without resarch  needed (until later needed).
